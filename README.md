# THKeyVis

Touhou STG Keystroke Visualizer for my own setup. 99.99% vibe coded.

Without modifications, I don't think this works for anyone else, since my setup
is not very common:

- macOS. (I tried rust+raylib at first, but the LLM can't figure out how to
  handle macOS permissions, so I gave up and turned to swift+swiftUI, which
  means this project is worthless for you if you are on other OSs.)
- ergodox-like keyboard.
